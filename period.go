// CanonicalZero is the zero length period in one of its possible representations.

// Period holds a period of time and provides conversion to/from ISO-8601 representations.
// Therefore, there are seven fields: years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
//
// In the ISO representation, decimal fractions are supported, although only the last non-zero
// component is allowed to have a fraction according to the Standard. For example "P2.5Y"
// is 2.5 years.
type Period string

// String returns the string.
